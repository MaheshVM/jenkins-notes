CI means 
	auto build-auto test
if disabled none of the pool scm & git web hook wont work.

post build actions -can perform java code analysis.

Jenkins directory structure:
----------------------------
/var/lib/jenins	default jenkins home directory

				/jobs inside we get the jobs
depends on number ofenvironmnet number of jobs are created

jobs
---
facebook-qa
facebook-dev
	nextbuildNumber-next coing build
		build->dir
log file contains which user created and deleted usin audit trail

maven project:
---------------
Plugin
-------------------------------

Jenkins 4

Deploy to container: deploy on tomcat, jboss server we do use
wild fly & Jboss both are same.
jenkins/restart		: using jenkins url can do
ulr/safeRestart		: 

for admin : we get Manage Jenkins
Urban code deployment:
in pom.xml we configure sonarqube scanner

Audit trail plugin : give the details about which user triggered the job

configure where the data about user will be created
/var/lib/jenkins/audit-trail.log	of size 10MB
log0
log1
..
we can speciffy the count file.

Software development Model- Waterfall->AGile-> Devops
Software Dev ARchitecture= Monolithic->SOA->Microservices

Objective of Devop:
	Immediate Release
	cost reduction
	improving quality
Jenkins will give CI
	CI= auto build & auto test
		we get immediate feedback
SDLC
	plan-code-code review-Build-UT(unit testing)-Packages-Archiving(Artifactory)-Deploy to QA -A Test->code coverage
		code review= sonarqube
	packages system packages : rpm,debian,
	application packages: jar,war,ear,zip,tar,
	
	Problem between packing & testing:Deploy 2 QA will be missing
	
	for 1 microservices, 10 packages, n number of packages are created.
Deployment 2 QA
---------------------
1 deployment 9 min
100 dep 9 min
tool can do the parallel deployment: ANSIBLE
	ANSIBLE: configuration management help you to coding
			deployment to all environment will be performed using :Ansible

1000 deployment in 1 sec
Docker & Kubernetes

after deployment we do Testing

Code coverage: 
	code coverage keep on reading run time environment.
	test cases to coverage of code process(jacoco,encover)
acceptance

Jira-git-sonarqube-maven-Junit-jar-Artifactory-Ansible-Selenium-Jacoco

all this will go automated work,

Architect-Developer-BR Team-QA Team-Operaton team
		Intergrate All phases	- CD Devops
		Integrate ALl tools
		Intergrate ALL people	Devops
			for all this we do use JENKINS
Jenkins has scheduling feature, testig
---------------------------------------------------------

session 2

Jenkins:
	Integrate tools
	way to automate manual steps
	scheduling
	Immediate feedback(gmail, chat)
pipeline is nothing but integration.
	what ever tools can be integrated on to jenkins.
Immediate feedback
Pipeline is nothing but integration.
"features of jenkins through Plugin" powered by plugin
	cloudbees offer the available by "prod Ready Plugin"- it is in enterprise edition paid
	
	Other Than jenkins: Bamboo, TravisCI, Teamcity
prerequisite: JRE+JDK

Front end Based on GUI

Using GUI can do:
		Integrating tools
		automate manual steps
		scheduling
		Immediate feedback
Backend(Slave or worker):
		will do all building, code review,
divided in to 2 
		WEB
		Node(master) can add slaves here to perform operation
		slaves can be linux or windows
Jenkins steps:
	Way to automate manual steps
	scheduling
	imeddiate feedback
	integration tools
Manage jenkins--Manage tools

Secret formula to use/work with Jenkins:
-----------------------------
what is your technology(java,.net.python, ruby, .net)
		what version do we use
		all may be any of the master or any node, and must be installed on any of the node.
where is the code?
	git
	svn
	p4
	tfs
		what is the repo location and access(user id & password)
what is your builder:
	anything
	maven,gradle, shell script
	for maven	pom.xml			goals: compile test package install deploy clean
		ant build.xml			target
		gradle gradle.build		step:
		msbuild defauilt.msbuild target

How frequently you want this job be triggered:
	hourly bases

How you want feedback:
	email- must configured

check all the questions one by one:
----------------------------------------
steps:
create New item
	free style version:
		
	Build Triggers:
		Build periodically	(for help ? click on it and get the help)
		
-------------------------------------------------

Session 4

default will be on Master
reading the logs is good to have
plugin is nothing but memory: functionality is available

global tool configuration:
if not available install plugin

jenkins is not sent, 
SMTP is used to send.


it may that create separate job for each, or one job for all stages
